# Gyrocks
A Vector Game For Oscilloscopes

Largely build onto Hudson Trammells teensyv/v.st project. v.st is a work from Trammell Hudson, License GPL


Modified version of https://github.com/osresearch/vst since I did never get the scopeclock to work.

Gyrocks is a 2,5D Game on the oscilloscope which uses many code from v.st.
